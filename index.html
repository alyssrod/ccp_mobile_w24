                    Hello, my name is Alyssa Rodriguez. I am a Sophomore at the University of Michigan, and I am studying Data Science with an intended dual degree in UX Design. 
                    I really wanted to learn web development since the CS curriculum only focuses on back end development.
                </p>
                <p class="info-paragraph">
                    During my free time, I like to give back to all the communities I'm a part of through volunteer work. 
                <p class="info-paragraph">
                    I have also had many experiences working on team projects, where I often miss the dynamics of my groups. I am the VP External for Michigan Build and Launch. A student run organization which is a hub for user-experience design, computer science and business students to come together and work on ventures. 
                </p>
                <p class="info-paragraph">
                    I am expereience in C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and R I am looking for opportunities to expand upon the skills that I have gained from my education and experiences.
